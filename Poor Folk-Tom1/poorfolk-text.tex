I have had it with all of these storytellers! They cannot write anything useful, pleasant, reassuring, all they do is uncover dirty secrets! I would ban them from writing! It is absolutely horrible: I get lost in what I am reading, and then all sorts of trash comes into my head; truly, I would ban them from writing; just ban them from writing anything at all.

My priceless Varvara Alekseyevna!

Yesterday I was happy, extremely happy, impossibly happy! For once in your life, you stubborn girl, you listened to me. It was eight o'clock in the evening, I am waking up (you know, precious, how I love to sleep for an hour or two after I leave the office), I got a candle, I am getting my papers in order, sharpening my quill, and suddenly, without any warning, I look up---honestly, my heart skipped a beat! You finally understood what I wanted, what my little heart wanted so badly! I see that the corner of your little curtain is turned up and hooked to your balsam plant, just exactly as I have been hinting you should do; just then I thought I could see your little face appearing in the window, too, that you were watching me from your little room, that you were thinking of me. How annoyed I was, my pet, that I could not see your little face very well! There was a time when even we saw clearly, precious. Old age is no walk in the park, my child! Now everything I see is hazy; I work a little in the evening, just copying something, and in the morning my eyes are all red and full of tears so that it is shameful to be seen by other people. But in my imagination, I could see your smile dawning, my little angel, your kind, friendly little smile; and my heart felt just the same as when I kissed you, Varyenka---do you remember that, my little angel? You know, my pet, I even thought that I could see you shaking your little finger at me? Were you, you naughty girl? I am certain that you will write about all of this in more detail in your letter.
