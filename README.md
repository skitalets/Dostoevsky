# Dostoevsky

These are rough drafts of a few works by Dostoevsky. I am actively (5/7/2015) working on _The Double_, an early Dostoevsky novella.

Currently I hold the copyright to all these translations and reserve all rights. I hope to put them under a fairly permissive license once they're polished and ready for publication, which will allow for mashups (such as adding critical apparatus, adapting for other media, etc.).
